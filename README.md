# Matrix Algebra System

## Overview

Please refer to the provided PDF document to see the homework description.

## File Structure

- `.GitHub/workflows/`: This contains a classroom.yml file, needed to run the GitHub tests.
- `src/`: This folder contains the files where you should make your changes.
- `tests/`: This folder contains all the test files.
- `CMakeLists.txt`: These files contain important code to help run the test cases for your files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not edit the `tests/` folder or the `CMakeLists.txt` file. You should only edit the files in the `src/` folder. Editing the `tests/` folder or the `CMakeLists.txt` file will cost you points.

## Code Submission

Once you have completed your tasks, simply upload/push the files/code to your repository. This will trigger GitHub to auto-grade your homework, which will then be reflected in GitHub or GitHub Classroom.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!

Good luck with your homework tasks!
